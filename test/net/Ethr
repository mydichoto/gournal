## Ethr: Ethr is a cross platform network performance measurement tool written in golang.
         The goal of this project is to provide a native tool for
         comprehensive network performance measurements of bandwidth,
         connections/s, packets/s, latency, loss & jitter,
         across multiple protocols such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS,
         and across multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux and other Unix systems.
